  <p>Hi <%= @fan.provider_identity %>,</p>

  <p>This is your monthly email from <a href="https://supportact.app">Support Act</a>, which makes gentle suggestions of albums you've streamed that you may wish to purchase.</p>

  <p>Here are albums you've recently had on high rotation that you haven't marked as purchased. If you do buy one to support the artist, mark it as purchased and we won't suggest it again ☺️.</p>

  <p>(Where we've been able to find them, we provide links to the artist's homepage, Bandcamp, Apple's iTunes, and Google's Store. There's plenty of links we've not yet found though - we'll keep hunting. And if you prefer vinyl, we highly recommend supporting <a href="https://recordstoreday.com/Stores?country=select">your local record store</a>.)</p>

  <div class="albums">
    <% @albums.each do |album| %>
      <div class="album unpurchased">
        <%= render :partial => "album", :locals => {:album => album} %>
      </div>
    <% end %>
  </div>

  <p>If you don't want to receive these emails, no worries at all - just <a href="https://supportact.app/my/account#remove">log in and delete your account</a>, you're welcome back at any point. You can also <a href="https://supportact.app/unsubscribe/<%= @fan.identifier %>">unsubscribe</a>, but this won't remove your data.</p>

  <p>Take care,</p>
